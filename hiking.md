There are some pretty cool places to hike in Flagstaff
There are the lava tubes, Mt Humphreys, Mt Elden, Fat Mans Loop, Walnut Canyon, Sandys Canyon, Kellys Canyon, etc...
There are also a lot of places around Flagstaff to hike like Sedona (Bell Trail)
If you havent been, I would reccomend checking some of these places out

Mt. Elden is a fun hike, Picture Canyon is a great hike as well.
